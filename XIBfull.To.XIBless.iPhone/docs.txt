Here is another simple way to remove the XIB reference from the project: delete the MainWindow.xib, 
right-click on the project name, select the menu Options, then IPhone Application and clean the "MainWindow"
 reference in the "Main Interface File" textbox. You can prevent the "Failed to load NSMainNibFile MainWindow" 
 error by doing so too.
